### **Contribution process**

#### **Ecosystem feedback**

We welcome feedback and requests from the ecosystem, and we invite interested stakeholders to open,
and engage with, issues on GitHub and other relevant public fora such as WICG. Facilitating public
discussion of feedback and requests allows the Privacy Sandbox team to take into consideration
feedback from the broader ecosystem and decide on the best course of action accordingly, based on
ecosystem priorities and the availability of resources.

#### **Pull Requests**

The Privacy Sandbox team has established some guidelines for pull requests in this repository.
Currently this repo is open for limited contribution only. We will carefully evaluate your
submission against the guidelines set out below. For pull requests which do not meet these
guidelines, we recommend that stakeholders instead file an issue on GitHub or raise the proposal in
other relevant public fora for further discussion.

**General Guideline**

-   We will accept small bug fixes or typo, small config changes, document updates for more clarity.
-   All changes must target the main branch.
-   All changes must adhere to the [Google Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for
    the development language.

#### **Merging pull requests**

Currently we are unable to merge pull requests directly into the main branch. Instead, once a pull
request is ready for merging, we will make the appropriate changes to our internal repository. They
will then be separately merged into the main branch.
