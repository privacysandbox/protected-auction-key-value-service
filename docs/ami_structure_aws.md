# AWS AMI Structure

## What is packaged in the AWS ami?

Let:

-   `$DIST = $WORKSPACE/dist`
-   `$AWS_PACKAGING = $WORKSPACE/production/packaging/aws`

## How are the binaries and files deployed on an EC2 instance?

![EC2 instance setup](assets/ec2_instance_setup.png)

## How is the server launched on EC2 instance launch?

The
[instance launch script](https://github.com/privacysandbox/protected-auction-key-value-service/blob/main/production/terraform/aws/services/autoscaling/instance_init_script.tftpl)
is used to startup the KV server and other relevant components when the EC2 instance is launched.
