# Loading data into the Key/Value server

There are two ways to populate data in the server.

-   The standard path is by uploading files to a cloud file storage service. The standard upload is
    the authoritative, high bandwidth and persistent source of truth.
-   The other way is via a low latency path. To apply such an update, you should send an update to a
    dedicated broadcast topic.

The data format specification is defined [here](/docs/data_loading/data_format_specification.md).
This doc talks about how to load the data.

-   We provide a
    [C++ library reference implementation](#using-the-c-reference-library-to-read-and-write-data-files)
    and a [CLI tool](#using-the-cli-tool-to-generate-delta-and-snapshot-files) that can be used to
    generate (or write) and read data files.
-   The reference library and CLI tool are ready to use as-is, or you can write your own libraries.
-   The data generation part is a general process that applies to all cloud providers.

# Before you start: choose your file format

Currently the files can be in one of multiple formats. When deploying the system, set the data
format parameter to instruct the system to read data files as the specified format.

-   For AWS: Set the [Terraform var](/docs/AWS_Terraform_vars.md) data_loading_file_format.
-   For Local: Set flag `--data_loading_file_format`
    ([defined here](/components/cloud_config/parameter_client_local.cc)).
-   For GCP: To be supported.

# Experimenting with sample data

## Generate sample data

A tool is available to generate sample data in [Riegeli](https://github.com/google/riegeli) format.
From the repo base directory, run:

```sh
-$ ./tools/serving_data_generator/generate_test_riegeli_data
```

Confirm that the sample data file `DELTA_\d{16}` has been generated.

# Using the CLI tool to generate delta and snapshot files

The data CLI is located under: `//tools/data_cli`. First build the cli using the following command:

```sh
-$ builders/tools/bazel-debian run //production/packaging/tools:copy_to_dist --//:instance=local --//:platform=local
```

After building, the cli will be packaged into a docker image tar file under
`dist/tools_binaries_docker_image.tar`. Using the generated docker image file is the recommended way
to run the data cli. Load the docker image into docker as follows:

```sh
-$ docker load -i dist/tools_binaries_docker_image.tar
```

Run the following to see a list of all available commands and their input arguments:

```sh
-$ docker run -it --rm \
    --entrypoint=/tools/data_cli/data_cli \
    bazel/production/packaging/tools:tools_binaries_docker_image \
    --help
```

This will print something like the following output:

```sh
-$ ...
Usage: data_cli <command> <flags>

Commands:
- format_data          Converts input to output format.
    [--input_file]     (Optional) Defaults to stdin. Input file to convert records from.
    [--input_format]   (Optional) Defaults to "CSV". Possible options=(CSV|DELTA)
    [--output_file]    (Optional) Defaults to stdout. Output file to write converted records to.
    [--output_format]  (Optional) Defaults to "DELTA". Possible options=(CSV|DELTA).
    [--record_type]    (Optional) Defaults to "KEY_VALUE_MUTATION_RECORD". Possible
                                  options=(KEY_VALUE_MUTATION_RECORD|USER_DEFINED_FUNCTIONS_CONFIG).
                                  If reading/writing a UDF config, use "USER_DEFINED_FUNCTIONS_CONFIG".
    [--csv_encoding]   (Optional) Defaults to "PLAINTEXT". Encoding for KEY_VALUE_MUTATION_RECORD values for CSVs.
                                  Possible options=(PLAINTEXT|BASE64).
                                  If the values are binary, BASE64 is recommended.

  Examples:
...

- generate_snapshot             Compacts a range of delta files into a single snapshot file.
    [--starting_file]           (Required) Oldest delta file or base snapshot to include in compaction.
    [--ending_delta_file]       (Required) Most recent delta file to include compaction.
    [--snapshot_file]           (Optional) Defaults to stdout. Output snapshot file.
    [--data_dir]                (Required) Directory (or S3 bucket) with input delta files.
    [--working_dir]             (Optional) Defaults to "/tmp". Directory used to write temporary data.
    [--in_memory_compaction]    (Optional) Defaults to true. If false, file backed compaction is used.
  Examples:
...
-$
```

As an example, to convert a CSV file to a DELTA file, run the following command:

```sh
-$ docker run -it --rm \
    --volume=$PWD:$PWD \
    --user $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    --entrypoint=/tools/data_cli/data_cli \
    bazel/production/packaging/tools:tools_binaries_docker_image \
    format_data \
    --input_file="$PWD/data.csv" \
    --input_format=CSV \
    --output_file="$PWD/DELTA_0000000000000001" \
    --output_format=DELTA
```

Here are samples of a valid csv files that can be used as input to the cli:

```sh
# The following csv example shows csv with simple string value.
key,mutation_type,logical_commit_time,value,value_type
key1,UPDATE,1680815895468055,value1,string
key2,UPDATE,1680815895468056,value2,string
key1,UPDATE,1680815895468057,value11,string
key2,DELETE,1680815895468058,value2,string

# The following csv example shows csv with set values.
# By default, column delimiter = "," and value delimiter = "|"
key,mutation_type,logical_commit_time,value,value_type
key1,UPDATE,1680815895468055,elem1|elem2,string_set
key2,UPDATE,1680815895468056,elem3|elem4,string_set
key1,UPDATE,1680815895468057,elem6|elem7|elem8,string_set
key2,DELETE,1680815895468058,elem10,string_set
```

Note that the csv delimiters for set values can be changed to any character combination, but if the
defaults are not used, then the chosen delimiters should be passed to the data_cli using the
`--csv_column_delimiter` and `--csv_value_delimiter` flags.

And to generate a snapshot from a set of delta files, run the following command (replacing flag
values with your own values):

```sh
-$ export DATA_DIR=<data_dir>;
docker run -it --rm \
    --volume=/tmp:/tmp \
    --volume=$DATA_DIR:$DATA_DIR \
    --user $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    --entrypoint=/tools/data_cli/data_cli \
    bazel/production/packaging/tools:tools_binaries_docker_image \
    generate_snapshot \
    --data_dir="$DATA_DIR" \
    --working_dir=/tmp \
    --starting_file=DELTA_0000000000000001 \
    --ending_delta_file=DELTA_0000000000000010 \
    --snapshot_file=SNAPSHOT_0000000000000001
    --stderrthreshold=0
```

The output snapshot file will be written to `$DATA_DIR`.

# Using the C++ reference library to read and write data files

The C++ reference library implementation can be found under:
[C++ data file readers](/public/data_loading/readers) and
[C++ data file writers](/public/data_loading/writers). To write snapshot files, you can use
[Snapshot writer](/public/data_loading/writers/snapshot_stream_writer.h) and to write delta files,
you can use [Delta writer](/public/data_loading/writers/delta_record_stream_writer.h). Both files
can be read using the [data file reader](/public/data_loading/readers/delta_record_stream_reader.h).
The source and destination of the provided readers and writers are required to be `std::iostream`
objects.

# Writing your own C++ data libraries

Feel free to use the C++ reference library provided above as examples if you want to write your own
data library. Keep the following things in mind:

-   Make sure the output files adhere to the
    [specification](/docs/data_loading/data_format_specification.md).
-   Snapshot files must be written with metadata specifying the starting and ending filenames of
    records included in the snapshot. See
    [SnpashotMetadata proto](/public/data_loading/riegeli_metadata.proto).

# Upload data files to AWS

The server watches an S3 bucket for new files. The bucket name is provided by you in the Terraform
config and is globally unique.

> Note: Access control of the S3 bucket is managed by your IAM system on the cloud platform. Make
> sure to set the right permissions.

You can use the AWS CLI to upload the sample data to S3, or you can also use the UI.

```sh
-$ S3_BUCKET="[[YOUR_BUCKET]]"
-$ aws s3 cp riegeli_data s3://${S3_BUCKET}/DELTA_001
```

> Caution: The filename must start with `DELTA_` prefix, followed by a 16-digit number.

Confirm that the file is present in the S3 bucket:

![the delta file listed in the S3 console](/docs/assets/s3_delta_file.png)

## Upload data files to GCP

Similar to AWS, the server in GCP watches a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket configured by your
Terraform config. New files in the bucket will be automatically uploaded to the server. You can
uploade files to your GCS bucket through Google Cloud Console.

![files listed in the Google Cloud Console](/docs/assets/gcp_gcs_bucket.png)

Alternatively, you can use [gsutil tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) to upload
files to GCS. For example:

```sh
export GCS_BUCKET=your-gcs-bucket-id
gsutil cp DELTA_* gs://${GCS_BUCKET}
```

# Realtime updates

The server exposes a way to post low latency updates. To apply such an update, you should send a
delta file to a dedicated broadcast topic.

## AWS

![Realtime design](/docs/assets/realtime_design.png)

In the case of AWS it is a Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic. That topic is created in
terraform
[here](https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-key-value-service/blob/7f3710b1f1c944d7879718a334afd5cb8f80f3d9/production/terraform/aws/services/data_storage/main.tf#L107).
Delta files contain multiple rows, which allows you to batch multiple updates together. There is a
[limit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-messages.html)
of 256KB for the message size.

Each data server listens to that topic by longpolling a subscribed queue. Once the update is
received, it is immediately applied to the in-memory data storage.

## GCP

The setup is similar to AWS above. The differences are in terminology:

-   Sns->Topic
-   Sqs->Subscription
-   EC2->VM

In the case of GCP it is a PubSub topic. That topic is created in terraform
[here](/production/terraform/gcp/services/realtime/main.tf) Delta files contain multiple rows, which
allows you to batch multiple updates together. There is a
[limit](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas#resource_limits) of 10MB for the message size.

Each data server is subscribed to the topic through
[streaming pull](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pull#streamingpull_api). "The StreamingPull
API relies on a persistent bidirectional connection to receive multiple messages as they become
available". Once the update is received, it is immediately applied to the in-memory data storage.

## Data upload sequence

The records you modify through the realtime update channel should still be added to the standard
data loading path. If it is not, then that update can be lost, for example, during a server restart.
The standard upload is the authoritative and persistent source of truth, and the low latency update
allows to speed up the update latency.

![Realtime sequence](/docs/assets/realtime_sequence.png)

As per the diagram below, first you should
[write](#using-the-c-reference-library-to-read-and-write-data-files) the updates to a delta file
that will be uploaded via a standard path later. The purpose of this step is to guarantee that this
record won't be missed later.

Then you should [send](#sample-upload) the high priority updates. Note, that here you _probably_
want to generate new delta files specific to what will be sent to SNS, but you could reuse the ones
you generated above.

Then, once you're ready to upload your delta file via a [standard path](#upload-data-files-to-aws),
you should do it. This step should be performed after you sent the data to the low latency path.
Storing the low latency updates in the standard path persists them. Therefore the standard path
files serve as journals so when the servers restart, they can recover the low latency updates
through the standard path files. We recommend to limit as much as possible the time between the low
latency update time and its journaling time to reduce the inconsistency between servers that receive
data from low latency path and servers that have to reapply the updates through the standard journal
path.

Technically, the first step can be performed after sending updates to the low latency path, as long
as you guarantee that that data won't be lost and is persisted somewhere.

## Sample upload

### AWS CLI

Before running the below command, make sure that you've set the correct AWS variables
(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) that allow you to communicate with your AWS resources.

```sh
topic_arn=....your realtime SNS topic ARN...
// sample delta file name
file=$(base64 DELTA_1675868575987012)
aws sns publish --topic-arn "$topic_arn" --message "$file"
```

### GCP CLI

Before running the below command, make sure that you've set the correct GCP project

```sh
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT
```

Publish command

```sh
topic_arn=....your realtime SNS topic ARN...
// sample delta file name
file=$(base64 DELTA_1675868575987012)
gcloud pubsub topics publish "$topic_arn" --message "$file"
```
