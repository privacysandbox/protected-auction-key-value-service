# ![Privacy Sandbox Logo](docs/assets/privacy_sandbox_logo.png) FLEDGE Key/Value service

# Background

FLEDGE API is a proposal to serve remarketing and other custom-audience ads without third-party
cookies. FLEDGE executes the ad auction between the buyers (DSP) and the sellers (SSP) locally, and
receives real-time signals from the FLEDGE K/V servers. To learn more about

-   FLEDGE for the Web: [explainer](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/fledge/)
    and the [developer guide](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fledge-api/).
-   FLEDGE on Android:
    [design proposal](https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/fledge) and
    the
    [developer guide](https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/guides/fledge).

When the auction is executed, separate
[FLEDGE K/V servers](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE_Key_Value_Server_API.md)
are queried for the buyers and sellers. When a buyer is making a bid, the DSP K/V server can be
queried to receive real-time information to help determine the bid. To help the seller pick an
auction winner, the SSP K/V server can be queried to receive any information about the creative to
help score the ad.

# State of the project

The current codebase represents the initial implementation and setup of the Key/Value server. It can
be integrated with Chrome and Android with the
[Privacy Sandbox unified origin trial](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/expanding-privacy-sandbox-testing/)
and
[Privacy Sandbox on Android Developer Preview](https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/program-overview).
Our goal is to present the foundation of the project in a publicly visible way for early feedback.
This feedback will help us shape the future versions.

The implementation, and in particular the APIs, are in rapid development and may change as new
versions are released. The query API conforms to the
[API explainer](https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE_Key_Value_Server_API.md). At the
moment, to load data, instead of calling the mutation API, you would place the data as files into a
location that can be directly read by the server. See more details in the
[data loading guide](/docs/data_loading/loading_data.md).

Currently, this service can be deployed to 1 region of your choice. Multi-region configuration is up
to the service owner to configure.

## Current features

### Build and deployment

-   Source code is available on Github
-   Releases are done on a regular basis
-   Binaries can be built from source code
    -   C++ binary
    -   [AWS & GCP] Docker container image
    -   [AWS]: Nitro EIF
    -   [AWS]: Reference AMI
    -   Other tools
-   Server can run as a standalone local process for testing without any cloud dependency or
    TEE-related functionality
-   Server can be deployed to AWS Nitro enclave
-   Server can be deployed to GCP Confidential Space
-   Reference terraform available for a clean and comprehensive deployment to AWS or GCP
    -   Clean: assumes the cloud environment has no preset infrastructure
    -   Comprehensive: deploys all dependencies and some recommended (but not necessarily required)
        configuration
    -   Many server behaviors can be configured by parameter flags without having to rebuild

### Data loading

-   Server loads key/value data from cloud file storage
-   Server loads key/value data from cloud pub/sub services
-   Server loads data into an in-RAM representation for query serving
-   Server continuously monitors for new data and incrementally updates ("delta files") the in-RAM
    representation
-   Support independent data ingestion pipelining by monitoring directories in cloud file storage
    independently
-   Supports Flatbuffers as the data event format
-   Supports Avro and Riegeli as the data file format
-   Supports snapshot files for faster server start up
-   Users can perform compactions of delta files into snapshot files in an offline path

### Read request processing

-   Support Protected Audience Key Value Server query spec: can be used as a BYOS server to serve
    requests from Chrome
-   Support simple key value lookups for queries
-   Users can write "user defined functions" to execute custom logic to process queries
-   User defined functions can be written in JavaScript or WASM
-   User defined functions can call "GetValues" to look up key value from the dataset

### Advanced features

-   Set-as-a-value is supported
    -   A key "value" pair in the dataset can be a key and a set of values
-   UDF can call "RunQuery" API to run set operations on sets (intersection, union, difference)
-   For GCP, Terraform supports deploying into an existing VPC, such as used by the Bidding and
    Auction services Non-prod Server logs are persisted after server shutdown
-   Data can be sharded and different servers may load and serve different shards (subset) of the
    dataset.
-   Sharding supports data locality, where the operator specifies "sharding key" for key value pairs
    so different key value pairs can have the same sharding key.

## **Timeline and roadmap**

The following sections include the timelines for the Trusted Key Value Server for Protected
Auctions. Protected Auctions refer to Protected Audiences and Protected App Signals ad targeting
products.

## Breaking changes

While we make efforts to not introduce breaking changes, we expect that to happen occasionally.

The release version follows the `[major change]-[minor change]-[patch]` scheme. All 0.x.x versions
may contain breaking changes without notice. Refer to the [release changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) for the
details of the breaking changes.

At GA the version will become 1.0.0, we will establish additional channels for announcing breaking
changes and major version will always be incremented for breaking changes.
